## OpenCloud Apps and Extensions

Please follow the steps provided in our [developer documentation](https://docs.opencloud.eu/services/web/#web-apps) if you want to install any of the
following apps and extensions. For some of them there are released artifacts, others still need to be built from source code.

### Build your own

If you want to build your own apps and extensions, the place to start is our [app boilerplate](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/web-app-skeleton).
